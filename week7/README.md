- Part 2
The majority of the CpG dinucleotides are methylated

- Question 3b
The ONT sequencing has smaller spread and the bisulphite sequencing has more reads with greater coverage which seems to be the better method to use. 

- Question 3d 
The two different approaches work relatively similar, the methods seem to detect greater number of methlation changes in the ONT dataset.  

- Question 5
In the tumor region, the region is more methylated which means the gene is repressed and cannot methylate other genes. This can lead to tumor growth.  

- Question 6
For a gene to be "imprinted", it means one copy of the gene is repressed while the other gene is expressed. 

- Question 7
When we phase the reads, we separate them into haplotypes which requires variation in allele to phase the reads. 

- Question 8
We cannot phase all reads because some of them do not have enough information, like enough variation in alleles to cluster into haplotypes.
