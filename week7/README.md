- Question 1
The majority of the CpG dinucleotides are methylated

- Part 3a

- Question 2

- Question 3

- Question 4

- Question 5
In the tumor region, the region is more methylated which means the gene is repressed and cannot methylate other genes. This can lead to tumor growth.  

- Question 6
For a gene to be "imprinted", it means one copy of the gene is repressed while the other gene is expressed. 

- Question 7
When we phase the reads, we separate them into haplotypes which requires variation in allele to phase the reads. 

- Question 8
No, we cannot phase all reads. Some of them do not have enough information, like enough variation in alleles to cluster into haplotypes.
